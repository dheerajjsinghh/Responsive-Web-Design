                <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.</p>
                <p>It is a very popular language, despite being old.</p>
                <p>C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.</li>
                    <li>C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.</li>
                    <li>C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies.</li>

            <article>
                <p>Just to give you a little excitement about C programming, below is a small conventional C Programming Hello World program.</p>
                <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
                  
                  int main() {
                    printf("Hello World!");
                    return 0;
                  }
                </code>
                <h3>Program explained</h3>
                <p>Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such as printf() (used in line 4). Header files add functionality to C programs.</p>
                <p>Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.</p>
                <p>Line 3: Another thing that always appear in a C program, is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.</p>
                <p>Line 4: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example it will output "Hello World".</p>
                <p>Line 5: return 0 ends the main() function.</p>
                <p>Line 6: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.</p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Comments">
          <header>Comments</header>
          <article>
            <p>Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.</p>
            <p>Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.</p>
            <h3>Single-line Comments</h3>
            <p>Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//). Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).</p>
            <code>// This is a comment
              printf("Hello World!");
            </code>
            <h3>Multi-line Comments</h3>
            <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */. Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:</p>
            <code>/* The code below will print the words Hello World!
              to the screen, and it is amazing */
              printf("Hello World!");
            </code>

          <header>Variables</header>
          <article>
            <p>Variables are containers for storing data values. In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.</li>
              <li>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.</li>
              <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Declaring (Creating) Variables</h3>
            <p>To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
            <code>type variableName = value;</code>
            <p>Where type is one of C types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign a value to the variable. So, to create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:</p>
            <p>Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign the value 15 to it:</p>
            <code>int myNum = 15;</code>
            <h3>Format Specifiers</h3>
            <p>Format specifiers are used together with the printf() function to tell the compiler what type of data the variable is storing. It is basically a placeholder for the variable value.</p>
            <p>A format specifier starts with a percentage sign %, followed by a character.</p>
            <p>For example, to output the value of an int variable, you must use the format specifier %d or %i surrounded by double quotes, inside the printf() function:</p>
            <code>int myNum = 15;
              printf("%d", myNum);  // Outputs 15
            </code>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
          <header>Data Types</header>
          <article>
            <p>A variable in C must be a specified data type, and you must use a format specifier inside the printf() function to display it:</p>
            <code>// Create variables
              int myNum = 5;             // Integer (whole number)
              float myFloatNum = 5.99;   // Floating point number
              char myLetter = 'D';       // Character
              
              // Print variables
              printf("%d\n", myNum);
              printf("%f\n", myFloatNum);
              printf("%c\n", myLetter);
            </code>
            <h3>Basic Data Types</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>int - Stores whole numbers, without decimals(2 or 4 bytes)</li>
              <li>float - Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 7 decimal digits(4 bytes)</li>
              <li>double - Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits(8 bytes)</li>
              <li>char - Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values(1 byte)</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
          <header>Constants</header>
          <article>
            <p>When you don't want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):</p>
            <code>const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
              myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum'
            </code>
            <p>You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change:</p>
            <code>const int minutesPerHour = 60;
              const float PI = 3.14;
            </code>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
          <header>Operators</header>
          <article>
            <p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:</p>
            <code>int myNum = 100 + 50;</code>
            <p>Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:</p>
            <code>int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
              int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
              int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
            </code>
            <p>C divides the operators into the following groups:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
              <li>Assignment operators</li>
              <li>Comparison operators</li>
              <li>Logical operators</li>
              <li>Bitwise operators</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
          <header>Statements</header>
          <article>
            <p>C has the following conditional statements:</p>
            <h3>The if Statement</h3>
            <p>Use the if statement to specify a block of C code to be executed if a condition is true.</p>
            <code>if (condition) {
              // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
              }
            </code>
            <p>In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, print some text:</p>
            <code>if (20 > 18) {
              printf("20 is greater than 18");
              }
            </code>
            <h3>The else Statement</h3>
            <p>Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.</p>
            <code>if (condition) {
              // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
              } else {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
              }
            </code>
            <code>int time = 20;
              if (time < 18) {
                printf("Good day.");
              } else {
                printf("Good evening.");
              }
              // Outputs "Good evening."
            </code>
            <p>In the example above, time (20) is greater than 18, so the condition is false. Because of this, we move on to the else condition and print to the screen "Good evening". If the time was less than 18, the program would print "Good day".</p>
            <h3>The else if Statement</h3>
            <p>Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.</p>
            <code>if (condition1) {
              // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
              } else if (condition2) {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
              } else {
                  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
              }
            </code>
            <code>int time = 22;
              if (time < 10) {
                printf("Good morning.");
              } else if (time < 20) {
                printf("Good day.");
              } else {
                printf("Good evening.");
              }
              // Outputs "Good evening."
            </code>
            <p>In the example above, time (22) is greater than 10, so the first condition is false. The next condition, in the else if statement, is also false, so we move on to the else condition since condition1 and condition2 is both false - and print to the screen "Good evening". However, if the time was 14, our program would print "Good day."</p>
            <h3>Switch Statement</h3>
            <p>Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.nThe switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:</p>
            <code>switch(expression) {
              case x:
              // code block
              break;
              case y:
              // code block
              break;
              default:
              // code block
             }
            </code>
            <p>This is how it works:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The switch expression is evaluated once</li>
              <li>The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case</li>
              <li>If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed</li>
              <li>The break statement breaks out of the switch block and stops the execution</li>
              <li>The default statement is optional, and specifies some code to run if there is no case match</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:</p>
            <code>int day = 4;
              switch (day) {
                case 1:
                printf("Monday");
                break;
                case 2:
                printf("Tuesday");
                break;
                case 3:
                printf("Wednesday");
                break;
                case 4:
                printf("Thursday");
                break;
                case 5:
                printf("Friday");
                break;
                case 6:
                printf("Saturday");
                break;
                case 7:
                printf("Sunday");
                break;
              }
              // Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)

          <header>Loops</header>
          <article>
            <p>Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.</p>
            <p>Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.</p>
            <h3>While Loop</h3>
            <p>The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:</p>
            <code>while (condition) {
              // code block to be executed
             }
            </code>
            <p>In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:</p>
            <code>int i = 0;
              
              while (i < 5) {
                printf("%d\n", i);
                i++;
              }
            </code>
            <h3>The Do/While Loop</h3>
            <p>The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.</p>
            <code>do {
              // code block to be executed
             }
             while (condition);
            </code>
            <p>The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:</p>
            <code>int i = 0;

              do {
                printf("%d\n", i);
                i++;
              }
              while (i < 5);
            </code>
            <h3>For Loop</h3>
            <p>When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:</p>
            <code>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
              // code block to be executed
             }
            </code>
            <p>Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.</p>
            <p>Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.</p>
            <p>Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.</p>
            <p>The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:</p>
            <code>int i;
              for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                printf("%d\n", i);
              }
            </code>
